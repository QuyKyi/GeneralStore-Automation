# General Store Mobile Automation Testing

This repository contains a suite of automated tests for the General Store mobile application, focusing on end-to-end test automation using Python. The project demonstrates how to automate UI testing for mobile applications, utilizing tools like Pytest for executing tests and generating reports with Allure.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories and files:

- **Screenshots**: A folder intended for storing screenshots captured during test executions, likely for debugging and documentation purposes.
- **requirements.txt**: A text file listing the Python packages required for the project, facilitating easy installation via pip.
- **.pytest_cache**: A directory used by pytest to store information about the previous runs to optimize future test executions. This directory is typically not included in version control.
- **Page_Actions**: Contains Python scripts defining actions that can be performed on the mobile application's pages. These actions encapsulate the logic for interacting with the app's UI elements.
- **Utilities**: A collection of utility scripts providing common functionalities that support the test scripts, such as logging, data parsing, or environment setup.
- **Logs**: Intended for storing log files generated during test execution. These logs are crucial for troubleshooting and understanding the flow of test execution.
- **main.py**: The main Python script that likely orchestrates the execution of the test suite. Running this script might initiate the tests and potentially aggregate results or perform cleanup.
- **allureReport**: This directory is designated for storing test reports generated by Allure, a popular framework for test reporting. Allure provides insightful and visually appealing reports on test execution outcomes.
- **Consts**: Contains Python scripts or modules defining constants used throughout the test suite. These constants might include fixed values like URLs, timeouts, or error messages.
- **ConfigurationData**: Stores configuration files or scripts that provide necessary settings for the test execution, such as device configurations, app details, or test environment specifics.
- **TestCases**: Includes Python scripts or modules that define individual test cases. These scripts contain the logic for executing specific test scenarios against the mobile application.
- **.idea**: A directory related to JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA or PyCharm IDEs, containing project-specific settings and preferences. This directory is generally not included in version control as it pertains to personal development environment settings.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Android Studio (if running tests on an Android emulator) or ADB setup for real device testing
- Pycharm
- Appium 1.22.3

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/QuyKyi/mobile_automation_python_GeneralStore.git

```
2. **Setup:**
   
   2.1 **Python Intepreter**

   2.2 **Updating Your Environment Variables**
   
   ```
      # Setting PATH for Python 3.12
      # The original version is saved in .zprofile.pysave
      PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin:${PATH}"
      export PATH
      export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
      export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
      export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/quy.kyi/Library/Android/sdk
      export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$PATH:/Users/quy.kyi/Library/Android/sdk/tools/bin"
      export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_202.jdk/Contents/Home
      export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
      export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/lib
      export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
      export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
      export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
      export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools
      export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
      export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/lib/x86_64
      # Setting PATH for Python 3.11
      # The original version is saved in .zprofile.pysave
      PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin:${PATH}"
      export PATH
   ```

3. **Run Allure Report:**

Ensure you are in the project directory before running these commands.
Generate the Allure report by executing the following command:

```
   pytest --alluredir="/Users/quy.kyi/Documents/GitHub/mobile_automation_python_GeneralStore/allureReport"

```

Once the tests have completed and the Allure results are generated, you can serve the Allure report locally using:

```
   allure serve /Users/quy.kyi/Documents/GitHub/mobile_automation_python_GeneralStore/allureReport

```

This will start a local web server and open the generated Allure report in your default web browser.

### Notes:
- Replace `/Users/quy.kyi/Documents/GitHub/mobile_automation_python_GeneralStore/allureReport` with the actual path to your Allure report directory if it differs.
- Ensure that Allure is installed on your machine. If Allure is not installed, you can typically install it via package managers like `brew` for macOS (`brew install allure`) or by following the installation instructions on the [Allure Framework website](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/).
- This instruction assumes that the user has `pytest` and `allure-pytest` already set up in their environment. If not, you might want to include steps for setting up these prerequisites as well.
